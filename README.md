##Overview Of The Project

###project :  A Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It  prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it will perform the selected operation and display the result to the
user. 

### Purpose of the Program:
I have created a basic calculator that allows users to perform four mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Key Activities:
Depending on the user's choice:
For addition, I added the two numbers.
For subtraction, I subtracted the second number from the first.
For multiplication, I multiplied the two numbers.
For division, I divided the first number by the second (handling division by zero).

### User Interaction:
The program prompts the user to:
Enter two numbers.
Choose an operation by selecting from the displayed menu.

### Input Validation:
I validated the operation choice to ensure the user selects a valid number between 1 and 4.
I converted the entered numbers to floating-point values to allow calculations with decimal numbers.

### Error Handling:
The program raises an error if an invalid operation is selected.
It prevents division by zero and informs the user when this occurs.
It uses try and except blocks to catch unexpected errors and display appropriate messages.

### Output:
The program displays the operation performed and the result in a clear format, e.g., 5 + 3 = 8.
