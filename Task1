/*I have created a basic calculator that allows users to perform four mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program prompts the user to:
Enter two numbers.
Choose an operation by selecting from the displayed menu. 
validated the operation choice to ensure the user selects a valid number between 1 and 4.
I converted the entered numbers to floating-point values to allow calculations with decimal numbers.
The program raises an error if an invalid operation is selected.
It prevents division by zero and informs the user when this occurs.
It uses try and except blocks to catch unexpected errors and display appropriate messages
The program displays the operation performed and the result in a clear format, e.g., 5 + 3 = 8.
